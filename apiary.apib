# Notificare REST API
Unified remote push notifications and location services for iOS, Android and HTML5 apps. 
Create user profiles, categorize your users and devices, create/schedule any content-rich and actionable notification. 
Use Geo-Targeting, Geo-Fencing or iBeacon technology to provide the ultimate messaging experience. Sign up for free [here](https://dashboard.notifica.re/#/sign-up).

The API calls below are all authenticated. There are 4 types of authentication credentials:

- `email` / `password`: Used for signing in to your account and retrieving an access token

- `token`: Used for all calls that need account-wide access, such as stats, lists of applications, etc.

- `applicationKey` / `applicationSecret`: Only used for calls that originate from the device, e.g., registration, tags.

- `applicationKey` / `masterSecret`: Used for calls that are related to a specific application and originate from your backend system, e.g., push, user segments, user lists, device lists, regions.

All 4 types use normal Basic HTTP Authentication (username + password), in case of token, the password is ignored, so can be anything, e.g. "xxx"

# Group Import
Methods for importing collections of items. Files are assumed to be uploaded to Notificare Storage before they can be used in a new import. Use this [endpoint](http://docs.notificare.apiary.io/#upload) to upload a file.

## New Import [/import/{type}]

### New Import [POST]
Create a new import job for an application. This job might take some time to finish, depending on the size of the file you uploaded. You can retrieve the status of all the jobs by using the other endpoints below.
This request is authenticated with the `applicationKey` and  `masterSecret`.

### Import types

#### re.notifica.import.User (default)
Used to import a list of users. Every row in the referenced CSV should include at least a `userID`. userName is optional and defaults to `anonymous`. This import type has no extra settings.

#### re.notifica.import.Device
Used to import a list of devices. Every row in the referenced CSV should include at least a `deviceID`, `osVersion`, `appVersion` and `platform`.
The latter three can also be defaulted to whatever you put in the `data` field in the request. See the example, where `appVersion`, `platform` and `language` have default values.
There is one option in this import type, which is `overwrite`, defaults to `false`.

Recognized columns are:

+ deviceID (APNS device token or Android registration id)

+ osVersion

+ appVersion

+ sdkVersion

+ platform (iOS, Android)

+ osString (defaults to platform + osVersion)

+ deviceString (defaults to 'unknown')

+ lastActive (ISO Date, defaults to current date/time)

+ longitude

+ latitude

+ locationLastUpdated (ISO Date, defaults to lastActive)

+ timeZoneOffset

+ userID (If the userID doesn't exist yet, a new user will be created. If omitted, an anonymous user will be generated.)

+ userName (only used when userID is present. Defaults to 'anonymous')



#### re.notifica.import.UserSegment
Used to import a list of users into a segment. Every row in the referenced CSV should contain a `userID`.
The user segment to import into should be set as the `userSegment` property of `data`.
There is one option in this import type, which is `clear`. If set, it clears the segment before importing users, otherwise it just adds users. It defaults to `false`.


+ Parameters

    + type (required, string, `re.notifica.import.Device`)...The import type

# Group Notification
Methods to create, send and schedule notifications to a specific target audience, user or device.
Combines User, Segments, Tags and the location of the devices to provide you a powerful device selection query for your campaigns.
The 3 most important things to have in consideration when creating a new message is that `message` is always mandatory, the property `type` defines which type of content should be presented to the user and the combination of `message`, `extra`, `sound`, `badge` should be no bigger than 200 bytes.
You can send several types of content in your message. The array `content` should contain one or more objects according to the `type` of message. 
You can also add an array `actions` to your notifications by simply providing one or more objects. 

## Notification Types:

|:---------:|-------------|
| re.notifica.notification.Alert | The simplest form of notifications, it will display the message in a dialog/alert window. It does not require a content object. You can although add Action objects to it, actions will be added to the window as buttons. |
| re.notifica.notification.WebView | This type allows you to show any piece of HTML in a native WebView. It requires a Content object of type `re.notifica.content.HTML`. You can additionally add Action objects to this type of Notification. |
| re.notifica.notification.URL | Use this type to open any URL in a native WebView. It requires a Content object of type `re.notifica.content.URL`. You can additionally add Action objects to this type of Notification. |

| re.notifica.notification.Map | This type of notifications will use the device's native maps to display one or more locations. It requires one or more Content objects of type `re.notifica.content.Marker`. You can additionally add Action objects to this type of Notification. |

The user can then choose to rate the app in App Store/Google Play, to be remembered later to rate or to not rate at all. This type of Notification does not require any Content object. Also you can not add any more Action objects to this type of Notification. |
